# CQF Exercises

This repository contains CQL exercises for learning CQL authoring

## Setup

The exercises in this repository are best worked with the [CQL Atom Plugin](https://github.com/cqframework/atom_cql_support). If you do not have Atom and CQL Atom Plugin installed, follow the [How To Install](https://github.com/cqframework/atom_cql_support#how-to-install) instructions.

The easiest way to work these exercises is by downloading them locally (i.e. _cloning_ this repository to your local drive). To do this from within Atom, follow the instructions for [Cloning a repository](https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/github-package/#clone-repositories). When you get to the dialog asking for the repository to clone, provide this link:

```
https://github.com/cqframework/cqf-exercises.git
```

This link is also available from the `Code` button at the top of the repository home page in GitHub.

Once you have cloned the repository locally, navigate to the `input/cql` folder and open any of the exercises. Once you're in a CQL editor, you should see syntax highlighting and error reporting, and you can also execute the CQL by right-clicking and selectin `CQL | Execute` from the popup menu, or simply by pressing `F5`.

For more information on the Atom plugin, refer to the [Using CQL Support in Atom](https://github.com/cqframework/atom_cql_support#using-the-cql-support-in-atom) topic in the Atom CQL Support readme.
